# Grok Automation Starter

A minimal hello world for testing agentic CI/CD flows. Deploys to GitHub Pages automatically on push.

- Live: https://xaigrokfans.github.io/grok-automation-starter
- Agent Test: Create issues like "Add a counter button" and assign to @copilot for auto-PR.

Evolving toward full self-debug loops.
